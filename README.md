# Independent Service Heuristics

Rules-of-thumb for identifying candidate value streams and domain boundaries by seeing if they could be run as a separate SaaS/cloud product. Based on some of the ideas in the book _Team Topologies_ by Matthew Skelton [@matthewskelton](https://github.com/matthewskelton) and Manuel Pais [@manupaisable](https://github.com/manupaisable).

## Overview

When designing organizations for fast flow of change, we need to find effective boundaries between different streams of change. Techniques like Domain Driven Design (DDD) are very powerful for this, but can be quite involved and difficult to learn. An lightweight alternative is to ask "could this thing be run as a cloud-hosted (SaaS) service or product?". 

## How to use

Choose an area of the organisation's focus to be represented in software: a user journey, a "product", a possible business domain, a software service, an entire software application, a set of tasks for a single user persona, a possible value stream, etc.

Use the checklist below to ask questions about the candidate domain / service / application / value stream. The more "yes" or "probably" answers, the greater the chance that you have found a good candidate for being a separate stream of change. This means that we could arrange one or more Stream-Aligned teams to this area.

## Checklist

1. Could it make any logical sense to offer this thing "as a service"?
2. Could you imagine this thing branded as a public cloud service (like _AvocadoOnline.com_ ðŸ¥‘)?
3. Could this thing be managed a viable cloud service in terms of revenue and customers?
4. Could the organisation currently track costs and investment in this thing separately from similar things? 
5. Could this thing operate with minimal data from other sources?
6. Could this thing have a small/well-defined set of user types or customers (user personas)?
7. Could a team or set of teams effectively build and operate a service based on this thing?
